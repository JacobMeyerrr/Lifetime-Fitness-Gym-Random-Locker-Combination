# Lifetime-Fitness-Gym-Random-Locker-Combination
This is a simple program, written on the "C/C++ Compiler" iPhone app, which gives me a completely random four-digit locker combination every time I go to the gym. Every time you use the lockers there, you have to set a four-digit combination, and hopefully this program makes it as unlikely as possible that others can guess my combination (or remember it from before) and steal my stuff!
